#  Cryptography Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cryptography Portfolio** â€” a curated collection of cryptographic projects, educational implementations, and secure systems designed to demonstrate deep technical understanding of cryptographic principles, algorithms, and security protocols.

> This repository is part of a larger security portfolio and is continuously updated as new modules are completed.

---

##  Purpose

This portfolio serves as both a **learning tool** and a **showcase** of applied cryptography. Each module is built from the ground up using Python, focusing on clarity, correctness, and educational value. While not intended for production use, each project reinforces concepts vital to modern cryptography.

---

##  Completed Modules

###  [`rsa_from_scratch`](./rsa_from_scratch)
A full RSA implementation written in pure Python, featuring:
- Prime generation using the Miller-Rabin test
- RSA keypair creation (default: 2048-bit)
- PKCS#1 v1.5 padding for improved security
- Block-based encryption and decryption
- CLI support for user input and file encryption
- Fully documented and unit tested

##  Why Build from Scratch?

- Reinforce cryptographic math (modular arithmetic, number theory)
- Demystify black-box libraries by rebuilding core primitives
- Prepare for security certifications like **ECES**, **OSCE3**, or **Cryptography I (Stanford)**
- Showcase technical depth to potential employers
